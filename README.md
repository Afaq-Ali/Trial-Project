## üëã Hello!
This is the trial project for advanced design builders at Getro. Thank you for taking the time to work on these üôè .

## 1. Introduction
At Getro we build and power job boards for professional networks, sothey can aggregate all the open jobs from their member companies. We offer our customers the possibility of visually integrating the job board into their website by adding their header, hero and footer to it. See the structure and some examples below:

## 2. The trial project
This project involves implementing an advanced design in a simplified environment. We're using https://www.sierraventures.com/ for this project, so we need to copy their header, hero and footer into the sample job board in this repository. Check the following image:

## 3. Getting it done

### 3.1 Setting up the environment
We have created a very light version of our environment, so you can start working on it fast.
1. Make sure you have node, npm and gulp installed.
2. Fork this repository, and install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run `gulp` to start up the server and the sass compiler.

### 3.2 Files
We need to copy the header, hero and footer from sierraventures.com into this sample job board. For this you only need to modify files in the advanced-design folder. Here you can find the skeleton for the pieces we need to add - this skeleton was automatically generated by a script (not included in this repo) that: 1) creates the files and 2) copies all the css from the customer website.

You can find the following files and folders:
- **fonts:** add here fonts used in sierraventures.com
- **images:** add here images used in sierraventures.com
- **styles:** you can add more css files if needed
- **sstyles/_main.scs:** you can find all the css grabbed from sierraventures.com. It's imported inside .sierraventures-custom-part, so it only affects the header and footer, making sure it doesn't conflict with our job board styles. You don't need to touch this file.
- **sfooter.html:** html for the footer
- **sheader.html:** html for the header and hero
- **style.sass:** css to make some customizations and import other css files.


### 3.3 Implementing the design

#### 3.2.1 Generate scaffold :white_check_mark:
We did this step for you - scaffold files live in `/advanced-design`

#### 3.2.2 Grab CSS styles :white_check_mark:
We did this step for you - they live in `/advanced-design/styles/_main.css`.

#### 3.2.3 Copy fonts
Usually, you can find the names of all the required fonts in styles/_main.css  where they are included in the form of @font-face rules.
- Sometimes the font src is included in the @font-face rule.
- Sometimes fonts are connected from the client's site folder -copy them (a faster way is to copy assets from the browser's Source tab) into the fonts folder, and connect via @font-face in our style.sass file.
Sometimes fonts are connected via Google fonts or Typekit. In this case, you can connect the font by URL @import url(). Comment sections above the @font-face rules may contain the URL of these font sources.

#### 3.2.4 Copy HTML for header and footer
Copy all classes from the client's body tag and copy all containers related to the header into `header.html` and all containers related to the footer into `footer.html`.

Example:

header.html
```
<div class="cd_wrapper <client's body classes>">
  <client's header>

  </client's header>
</div>
```

#### 3.2.5 Review and fix styles
At this step, we should have similar elements to the client's site elements but sometimes there are mismatches. It‚Äôs often a problem with font rendering or the client's styles conflicting with ours. For example, if a client has `.container` or `.icon-bar` rules, they will conflict with ours. Fix these problems inside `styles.sass` right after the `@import './styles/main.scss'` section (don't do them in `styles/_main.scss`).

#### 3.2.6 Add interactions
The most common interaction we have to copy is mobile menu behavior. It's usually implemented with css classes. There are a number of ways to copy this:
- Set the right css classes after a button click on mobile;
- Try to copy the source code.

#### 3.2.7 Work with assets and links
- Make sure to change every relative link to an absolute link (replacing every `href=‚Äú/` with `href=‚Äúhttps://www.sierraventures.com/`) in both header.html and footer.html.
- Download every image used in these files and place them in `/advanced-deisgn/images/`. Make sure header.html and footer.html are using the images served by our site, not external sources (replace the image src).

#### 3.2.8 Testing
Make sure everything works well on different screen sizes and that the mobile menu works. The goal is to make it look as similar to the client‚Äôs site as possible.

## 4. That's everything!
